<!--My favourite games and their explanations-->
<h2>My Favourite Games</h2>

<h3>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
<p>CS:GO is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter game. It has various game modes and is played in teams. However, It can sometimes be irritating.</p>

<h3>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</h3>
<p>This game is like Counter Strike: Global Offensive. This has various game modes and is played in teams, too. But, this is more tactical than Counter Strike: Global Offensive.</p>

<h3>Euro Truck Simulator 2</h3>
<p>My other favorite game is Euro Truck Simulator 2. In this game, we need to use a truck to accomplish the delivery mission. We can also play this game online.</p>
