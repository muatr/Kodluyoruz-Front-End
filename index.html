    <h3>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
    <p>CS:GO is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter game. It has various game modes and is played in teams. However, It can sometimes be irritating.</p>
    <p>CS:GO map I made for Jailbreak mode:</p>

    <h3>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</h3>
    <p>This game is like Counter Strike: Global Offensive. This has various game modes and is played in teams, too. But, this is more tactical than Counter Strike: Global Offensive.</p>

    <h3>Euro Truck Simulator 2</h3>
    <p>My other favorite game is Euro Truck Simulator 2. In this game, we need to use a truck to accomplish the delivery mission. We can also play this game online.</p>

    <h3 id="footer">Stray</h3>
    <p>In this game, there is a cat and we manage this cat to complete some tasks. Also, we can walk around whenever we want and meow anytime we want.</p>
